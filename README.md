# Causal-Inference-Estimating-the-Profitability-of-Discounts

This project utilizes causal inference techniques to help an e-commerce company estimate the impact of discounts on profits. We explain how bias gets in the way of inferring the treatment effect of discounts on profitability, and how to adjust for it to attain more accurate results. Adjustment techniques such as weighted least squares and kernel weights are used along with regression discontinuity design (RDD).
