# Regression Discontinuity Design

This project utilizes demonstrates the use of regression discontinuity design (RDD) as a form of natural experiment that works as an alternative to A/B testing. RDD measures treatment effects at points of discontinuity to get an idea of the effectiveness of a program without needing to rigorously A/B test it. This technique was applied to assess the discounting strategy of an e-commerce company.
